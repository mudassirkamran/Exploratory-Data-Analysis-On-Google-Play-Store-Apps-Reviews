# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-On-Google-Play-Store-Apps-Reviews
This project studies a large Google Play Store dataset to understand how users interact with Android apps. The work uses exploratory data analysis in Python to clean the data and find patterns in ratings, reviews, installs, size, price and app categories. A second dataset with user reviews adds deeper insight into user behaviour.
